/// - This class contains the high-level knowledge necessary for making network calls to a given backend service.
///   That includes the basic configuration, authentication credentials, headers and any info necessary about
///   the responses, that are shared between endpoints of the same service.
///
/// - It decouples the rest of the application from the specifics of the network layer.
/// - This class does not support multiple requests in parallel. It cancels the previous request and starts a new one.
///   This is for simplicity as allowing multiple requests in-flight and cancelling them requires to expose a request
///   identifier out to the application. Note that it would be preferrable to expose an identifier an not the task as that's
///   a network technology implementation detail.
