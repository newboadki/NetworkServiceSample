/*
 * What I am looking to test in any component is its contract, or public API, while mocking
 * dependencies that are either not reliable enough for testing, like the network, or too slow/expensive.
 *
 * - In this NetworkService sample, the public API are the completion block and the parameters called in it,
 *   which should match the mocked network conditions.
 * - Another behaviour exposed through the use of the public API (and therefore should be tested) is the
 *   cancellation of the previous task, which I assumed to make it simpler.

     Cancelation of tasks can and should be tested in a commercial scenario,
     introducing logic into the session and task mocks to delay the call of the completion blocks.
     With this in place, the test would:
         - perform two calls to the API method under test
         - Expect that the first completion block does not get called.
         - Expect that the second completion call gets called.
